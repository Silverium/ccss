## Reset CSS

By default, **CCSS** uses `rem` units: `10 => 10rem`. To make this work as
`10px === 10rem`, you need to set the base `font-size` on your
HTML tag to `6.25%`:

```css
html {
    font-size: 6.25%;
}
```

> You can always set **CCSS** to a different unit or formula.

## Flex by default

Also you might want to reset your elements to be flex by default to avoid having
`d="f"` on many of your components. You may use
[flex-reset.css](https://gist.github.com/wintercounter/5e3f4915c714022a8dd048f55b48908d#file-flex-reset-css)
for this purpose.
