title: Pros and Cons
---

## Pros

-   **Small**: enables true CSS mangling. The bigger the codebase the more efficient.
-   **Fast**: a lot of efforts were taken to keep performance high.
-   **Design systems**: the implementation makes **CCSS** capable to create custom design systems.
-   **Extensible**: the core supports custom properties and custom value transformers.
-   **Utility-first**: aligns well with such methodologies.
-   **DX**
    -   Faster development
    -   Less coding
    -   Detailed TypeScript types and TSDoc to help your work.
    -   Benefits of similar utility first approach.
    -   Easy setup and usage.
    -   Support development time validators to help your team use your system properly.
    -   Deep and pseudo-selector support.

## Cons

-   Looks and feels weird at first sight.
-   The learning curve isn't so small (I wouldn't say it's big either).
-   Extra processing compared to static CSS files / non-dynamic `styled-components`.
-   Size saving makes more sense on bigger projects.
